# eventchatbot
Event chatbot is a simple Facebook Messenger chatbot, which gives you events in Helsinki. 

It was build on AWS Lambda. I followed the instruction from post (https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/run-facebook-messenger-chat-bot-on-aws-lambda-2fa800a67d76) to setup AWS Lambda. 

The chatbot fetches data from Helsinki Linked Events API (https://dev.hel.fi/apis/linked-events/).
